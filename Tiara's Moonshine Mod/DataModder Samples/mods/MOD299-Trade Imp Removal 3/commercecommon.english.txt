54	A purified potion that is safe for children. It doesn't restore HP, but it tastes fruity!
55	A potion that helps people lose weight. Drink it right before working out. This potion has jumped in popularity recently.
56	Pour this potion on a plate next to your bed before sleeping. It will produce a pungent smell that expands your nostrils, preventing you from snoring. Just remember to air your bedroom out the next day.
57	A potion made with a rare wild ginseng from the mountain behind Tir Chonaill. It restores Strength and has other beneficial effects. Be careful of giving to someone with a high body temperature.
58	A potion that brings true love between the two that drink it. Only works if your intended lover does not know what it is.
59	Special gloves made for gathering cobwebs. They are coated to prevent the cobwebs from sticking.
60	Special boots with sound-insulated soles. Makes it easier to sneak up on sheep.
61	A mask that resembles an Ogre Executioner. Often worn for self-defense at night.
62	A suit perfect for attracting attention. The Red Incubus Suit is popular these days.
63	A swimsuit for the Succubus. Only ever seen at noblemen's auctions, for some reason. It is very rare, and rumored to attract the Succubus, perhaps not in a good way.
64	A mineral used as fuel. It's a little heavy.
65	A slick white stone. It's often used for floor tiling in luxurious mansions. Tara Royal Castle purchased all marble produced in the last 7 years.
67	An ore that is synonymous with the weapons it is used to make, such as the Highlander Claymore. Blacksmiths like Ferghus have worked tirelessly to craft better weapons with this ore, but no one has discovered its true potential yet.
68	The world's heaviest metal. It is too soft to make weapons or armor from, but it has been researched exhaustively by Alchemists such as Leymore and Cai, trying to find a way to transmute it into gold.
69	A berry-granola mixture, baked in an oven. You can eat it with milk or as a dry snack.
70	A soft beer made with Emain Macha Butter. Even though it's called beer, it doesn't contain alcohol, so anybody can drink it.
71	The leg of some beast, wrapped in silver and smoked over an open fire. Whatever it is, it's pretty chewy.
72	Pasta made with white mushrooms. Since white mushrooms are so rare, this dish is a highly-valued delicacy.
73	Cooked bear from Emain Macha. To make this, you must tie the bear to a tree trunk, and cook it for a whole day while five strong men rotate it constantly. Definitely worth the effort, though.
74	A crystal made by compounding Fire and Wind Crystals. You can use it in cylinders, or as a heat pack.
75	This stone plays a saved sound when it is struck. Only works once.
76	A crystal that shines incredibly brightly for an instant when used in a cylinder. Excellent for blinding enemies. Just don't forget to cover your own eyes.

78	A crystal that can change a small life form into gold. However, it always creates less gold than it takes to make the crystal. Used to make gold beetles or gold minnows. Has no effect on large life forms such as dogs or humans.
79	A dressing table used by women. It's small enough for anyone to use.
80	A table made specifically for enjoying a cup of tea. It is round, with engraved patterns adorning its surface.
81	A rocking chair with a fluffy cushion, filled with cotton. Sitting in it for more than a few minutes will put you out for the night.
82	A bunk bed with stairs, made with consideration of children's safety. It's low enough that you can fall off and still be fine.
83	A huge rack for storing wine bottles. A collector's item due to its large size.
84	Seaweed that tastes good no matter how you cook it. Soggy seaweed gets stuck on the roof of your mouth, so be careful.
85	A shellfish with a unique smell. It is said that Edern eats them to stay healthy.
86	Part of the shark that's popular not for its taste, but for its rarity. Since it's hard to catch a shark at all, this remains an extremely rare dish.
87	A jellyfish. Since it's so slippery, it will go straight down your throat even if you don't chew. Don't forget to clean it before eating!
88	Scales dropped by Neid. You can obtain a few by pouring some water from Lake Neagh into the waters of Port Cobh. This will make the scales shine. Many consider the scales to be a symbol of luck.
89	An iron whip used to train horses. Just like a morning star, it has linked chains.
90	A black-bladed sword. Looks like an ordinary one-handed sword, just black.
91	A small safe crafted of solid steel, used for storing precious objects. Ordinary beings can't even move this thing.
92	Armor worn by the Skeleton Ogre. Since it's too heavy for humans, it's used more as a decoration than for battle purposes. It is said the wearer can have superhuman strength, but they probably had it just to be able to wear it at all.
93	A helmet that looks like just like Dark Lord Morgant's helmet. Don't expect it to have the same power, though!
