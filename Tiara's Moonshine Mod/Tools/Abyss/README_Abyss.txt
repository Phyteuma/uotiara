Installation:
1. Extract Abyss.7z/Abyss.rar to your Mabinogi folder. (The one where Client.exe and Mabinogi.exe are located.)

Uninstall:
1. *Delete Abyss.ini, Abyss_patchlog.txt, README_Abyss.txt, CrashReporter.dll and then rename CrashReporter.dat to CrashReporter.dll.

*If you have file extensions hidden: Abyss.ini will appear as Abyss, Mabinogi.exe as Mabinogi, etc.

F.A.Q.:
Q. Why is NGS detecting a threat?
A. If there was a maintenance, it's likely Abyss will need to be updated. If not, check the thread and search the forums.

Q. I have AbyssInjector.exe, RenameMe.dll, CrackShield.exe, dinput8.dll (in the Mabinogi folder, not Windows directory), ijl15.dll (Abyss, not Intel) or ijl15.dat and I don't see them in the new package, do I still need them?
A. No, the current version of Abyss only comes with Abyss.ini, CrashReporter.dll, CrashReporter.dat and README_Abyss.txt. Any older version of Abyss are not supported.

Q. Why is my Antivirus saying CrashReporter.dll is a threat?
A. I have packed them to make it harder for NGS to detect it. Antivirus tend to assume that anything packed is malicious, and rightfully so.

Q. How do I stop my Antivirus from deleting Abyss or saying it's a threat?
A. Google how to add exclusions to the Antivirus software you're using.

Q. I crash (can happen in many different scenarios).
A. Make sure your data folder and pack files are up to date; if it is, or you're POSITIVE you aren't using one, continue reading.

Q. Font is small.
A. Go to Abyss.ini and change Bitmap=1 to Bitmap=0 and the same with BitmapPositionFix.

Q. BugTrap (Client.exe) has stopped responding when trying to log in.
A. There is none at the moment as I don't know what is causing the issue.

Q. Mabinogi doesn't start, or shows up briefly.
A. Make sure you aren't using pake, otherwise I don't know.

Q. I click Start after choosing my character and the Client crashes before the loading screen.
A. Make sure your data folder isn't out of date. If that doesn't work then PM me your ingame name and server.

Any other problems that may occur:
Run the Client without Abyss. This will eliminate the possibility that anything else is causing an issue.
Try setting ExtraThreads to 0.
Make sure CrashReporter.dll is added as an exception in any Antivirus you have, it may be limiting what it can do.
Try changing your DNS to Google: https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using
If none of this works, post the issue with your log, along with what you've tried to do to solve said issue, if you can't find the same issue after searching.
